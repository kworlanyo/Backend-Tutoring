// History
// Typescript was created by microsoft
// There are a lot of developers that use java, c++, c-sharp and so on that are used to strict typing
// Javascript, python, php do not have strict typing.
/* 
JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.
In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.
TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.
For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.

// Installing typescript in a normal file
//* npm init -y
//* npm i typescript
// This command installs the compiler

// We have also install a configuration file
//* npx tsc --init

// We also run a code in the terminal to watch the changes. The changes will be compiled into javascript.
//* npx tsc --watch
//! NOTE. You need to have a file with a ts extension before you run the --watch command or else you will get an error.

// Locally in your project.
//* npm install -D ts-node

// Or globally with TypeScript.
//* npm install -g ts-node

//* npm i -g ts-node
